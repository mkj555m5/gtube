- **Device information** (Android version, device model)
- **App version** or commit hash

## 💡 Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please:

- Check if the feature has already been suggested
- Provide a clear description of the feature
- Explain why this feature would be useful
- Include mockups or examples if possible

## 🔧 Pull Requests

### Before You Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `main` or `develop`
3. Make sure you can build the project

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gtube.git
cd gtube

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/محمود محسن/gtube.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Code Guidelines

- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code

## 🔐 Release and Signing Invariants

gtube is distributed through GitHub Releases and
[IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/packages/io.github.mahmoudmohsen.flow). Both pin
properties of the published artifacts, so the following are hard constraints.
Breaking one of them cannot be fixed by a follow-up release — it forces every
installed user to uninstall and reinstall, losing their local data.

**The signing key never changes.** Every release APK must be signed with the
official key, certificate SHA-256
`4322294ed4caa2d4294140095818080ffe8acc1fbe3cdc76107df45c5286be40`. Android
refuses to install an update signed by a different key. CI enforces this in the
`Verify release signing certificate` step, which fails the build on a mismatch.
Never regenerate `release.keystore`, and never rotate the
`RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `STORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, or `KEY_PASSWORD`
repository secrets.

**Release asset file names are a public contract.** IzzyOnDroid matches release
assets by file name. `flow.apk` and `flow-foss.apk` are the universal builds
and must keep those exact names. The per-ABI APKs are published alongside them
as extras. Renaming or removing either universal APK silently breaks the
IzzyOnDroid update feed, so coordinate with IzzyOnDroid before changing them.

**`versionCode` must increase on every release.** F-Droid-format repositories
use it to detect updates. The ABI splits all share one `versionCode`, so the
universal APK is the only artifact IzzyOnDroid should consume.

**A tag build must never publish unsigned APKs.** `app/build.gradle.kts` falls
back to `signingConfig = null` when no keystore is present, which produces
uninstallable APKs. CI hard-fails a `v*` tag build when the keystore secret is
missing rather than publishing them.
